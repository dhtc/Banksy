Description: Banksy is an R package that incorporates spatial information to 
    cluster cells in a feature space (e.g. gene expression). To incorporate 
    spatial information, BANKSY computes the mean neighborhood expression and 
    azimuthal Gabor filters that capture gene expression gradients. These 
    features are combined with the cell's own expression to embed cells in a 
    neighbor-augmented product space which can then be clustered, allowing for
    accurate and spatially-aware cell typing and tissue domain segmentation.
